Project types

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/device_sectorial_scan

Sectorial Scan.
The image is formed in the acquisition device.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/show_image

Shows a single image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/sim_rectangular_flat_source-array

Simulation of acoustic field produced by an array of rectangular flat sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/sim_rectangular_flat_source-single

Simulation of acoustic field produced by a single rectangular flat source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/simulated_3d_single_virtual_source

Synthetic aperture imaging with all the active group elements transmitting,
with the focus point acting as a single virtual source.
The array transducer is simulated.
The reflector points can be in a 3d space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/simulated_3d_sta

Synthetic Transmit Aperture.
The array transducer is simulated.
The reflector points can be in a 3d space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/simulated_3d_t1r1saft

Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique, with 1 element transmitting and 1
receiving in each acquisition.
The array transducer is simulated.
The reflector points can be in a 3d space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/simulated_sta

Synthetic Transmit Aperture.
The array transducer is simulated.
The reflector points are in the x-z plane of the transducer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/single_acquisition

Executes only one acquisition, using a single transmit element and a single
receive element from an array transducer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/single_virtual_source

Synthetic aperture imaging with all the active group elements transmitting,
with the focus point acting as a single virtual source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/single_virtual_source_network_sync

Synthetic aperture imaging with all the active group elements transmitting,
with the focus point acting as a single virtual source.
The acquisitions are triggered by a network sync signal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/sta

Synthetic Transmit Aperture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/sta_network_sync

Synthetic Transmit Aperture.
The acquisitions are triggered by a network sync signal.

Labels

cyl
	Cylindrical wave: Uses only one array element in transmission.
dp
	Processing in double precision.
multi_layer
	Forms a 3D image using many 2D images (layers).
network
	Signal data obtained from a network server.
seq_y
	Obtains a sequence of images with the array moving in the y direction.
saved
saved_sequence
	Signal data obtained from saved files.
sp
	Processing in single precision.
synth_y
	The movement of a linear array in the y direction is used to simulate
	a synthetic 2D array.
vectorial
	The signals are converted to analytic signals, therefore the samples
	become vectors.
