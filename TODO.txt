- Check USLab4a::closeEvent(QCloseEvent* event) when the processing is enabled.

- Move Python scripts?

- [???] Sectorial grid in z-y.

- Waveform: 2a / 2b: numPeriods should be ignored (?).

- project_.loadImageFromHDF5(): Add file name as parameter?

================================================================================

Notes:

- After the interpolation, the signals may have maximum absolute value > 1.

- OGLFigureWidget: TRIANGLE_STRIP is 10% faster than TRIANGLES
  (OGLFIGUREWIDGET_USE_VERTEX_ARRAY = 1, Intel HD 2500).

================================================================================

x- Pre-process delays?
	continuous
		x DeviceSectorialScanMethod
			Already very fast, because the processing is done on
			the acquisition device.
		x SingleVirtualSourceMethod
			Not much faster (7%) and with much higher memory usage.
ok- STAProcessor -> ArrayProcessor
ok- simulated_3d_sta_acquisition_config_file -> simulated_3d_acquisition_config_file
	config-simulated_3d_sta_acquisition.txt -> config-simulated_3d_acquisition.txt
x- config-sta-cyl -> config-cyl
	Cylindrical wave imaging does not use synthetic aperture, but the
	processing uses the code for STA.
ok- Rename STA3DConfiguration -> SA3DConfiguration.
ok- Normalization network sync.
	ok- Save signals.
	ok- Imaging.
	x- Multi-layer.
ok- Normalization.
	ok Simulation.
	ok Experimental.
		x- Normalize signals in the network servers.
ok- Simulation: Use gain.
ok- Implement sta_simulated_3d_seq_y_save_signals.
